Description: Directory watcher uploading to remote storage via rclone
 This tool watches a local directory and mirrors files to any rclone
 backend (tested with WebDAV/Nextcloud). It normalizes filenames and
 extensions from MIME type, treats renames as remote moves, and uses a
 crash-safe two-phase upload with recovery. Includes a templated systemd
 unit, a wrapper and a setup helper.
